.:: NEWEST FEATURES: ScheduleTasks, bug fixes, hide all shell interactions.

.:: NOTE: Do not use UAC if you are already admin privileges or the payload will not execute

.:: CURRENT BUGS: Fun function does not stay with its 1 victim. If you hilight a different victim while on fun then it will go to them.
